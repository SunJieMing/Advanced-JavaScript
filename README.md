Notes: Thank you. These are great test exercises. I feel pretty confident about my ability to solve them all. Still not 100% confident about matchingLeaves tho. I am looking fwd to revisiting these tests later in the course to check my retention of the material and incorporation of the more advanced techniques we are learning now and as ES7+ comes into the world. :)
